    <h2>Full stack developer</h2>
    <p>
        A full stack developer designs, develops, and maintains both the front-end
         (user interface) and back-end (server, database) components of web 
         applications. They ensure seamless integration between the client side 
         and server side, delivering functional and visually appealing digital 
         solutions.
    </p>

    <h2>Penetration Tester</h2>
    <p>
        Penetration testers, also known as ethical hackers, simulate cyberattacks
         on an organizationâ€™s systems, networks, and applications to identify 
         vulnerabilities and provide recommendations for strengthening security 
         defenses.
